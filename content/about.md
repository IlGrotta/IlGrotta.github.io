Hey! I'm Giuseppe, aka ilGrotta, a software developer with a passion for creating stuff and test something new everyday.


I work mostly as Backend Developer for Banking system and in the electric billing field, but I also love to work on personal projects and contribute to open source.

Currently I can say I'm confident in:
* Java Spring
* Camel 
* Docker environments
* Kubernetes

but currently I'm learning to make frontend stuff, like Angular and  trying also some framework like Hugo to build my personal website.

I'm planning to work on some personal project, to improve my C++ skills, since I loved it when I was at university, but in the last years I didn't have the chance to use it in my work.
Also interessed in creating and understand WEB3 technologies, like Solidity and smart contracts.
